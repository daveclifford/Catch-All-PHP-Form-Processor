h1. Notes for thought


* Do I really need the settings array created in the constructor?
* write case for submit and textareas for create_field() method
* add in id and class vars to the create_field() method
* add auto-increment to create_field() ids if the $name has the '[]' string (indicating an array)
* build show_review_results() and show_errors() out
* breakout error and results processing from show_review_results() and show_errors() so the functions can remind abstracted (DRY!!!)
* add language support ??
